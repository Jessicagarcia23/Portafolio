			<h1> Banking System requiremts </h1>
			<h2>Customers will be able to do the following:
				Create Customers should be able to create an account with the bank, and a customer who has an account should be able to add additional accounts.</h2>
			<h3>For example a typical customer may have a current account 		and a savings account.</h3>
			<h4>Lodgment For the lodgment, a bank customer can specify the amount to lodge with the credit card that will be debited.</h4>
			<h5>Transfer For the transfer, the bank customer can specify the amount to transfer and an account to transfer to.</h5>
			<h6>Withdrawal For withdrawal, the bank customer can specify the amount to withdraw and the card that will be credited.
			Balance The customer can request a balance on any account at any time.1. An Introduction:
			The introduction will expand the problem statement to describe how the API fits together. For instance:
			a.      Textual description of the problem and the proposed solution.
			b.     An Entity-Relationship diagram would be a useful addition.
			c.      Security will be a concern across the whole API. Describe how you tackle that issue.
 
                                                                                                                        (10 Marks)
			Introduction is to be maximum 2 pages.
 
			2. The RESTful API:
			The API describes all the entry points for the above problem domain. Each entry point should be documented under the following headings:
 
			a.      API Name:  e.g. Users Resource
			b.     Description: e.g. This allows the retrieval of all user resources.
			c.     URI: e.g. /users
			d.     HTTP verb: e.g. GET
			e.     Parameters: e.g. user_id (Integer, Required), name (String, Optional), for a POST this would be a JSON object.
			f.      Resource contents: e.g. an example of the returned resource.
			g.     Pre-Conditions: e.g. no record for the user with the specified user_id must exist.
			h.     Post-Conditions: e.g. a new record for the user with the specified user_id exists.
                                                                                                                        (30 Marks)

 
			3. Prototype: 
			The API prototype, must be implemented according to the following requirements:
			a.    BACKEND: A server implementing at least THREE of the entry points listed above (Lodgment / Transfer / Withdrawal / Balance) returning resource representations in XML and JSON.
			b.    BACKEND: A server developed in Java which implements at least THREE of the entry points listed above (Lodgment / Transfer / Withdrawal / Balance) of the API using in-memory objects. Constraints should be implemented, balances should be updated and transactions should be remembered as the API is called. This should be achieved with a database.
			c.    FRONTEND: An HTML+JavaScript or Mobile or Desktop client calling ALL portions of the API. E.g., the client should check the account balance allowing a transfer or withdrawal.

			 
			You should provide screenshots to demonstrate the operation of the Web Service.
			 
			The prototype source code should also be included with the submission in a ZIP file. 
			 
                                                                                                                        (60 Marks)
